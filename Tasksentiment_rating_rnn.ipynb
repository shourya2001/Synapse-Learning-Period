For this we'll use [spaCy](https://spacy.io/), which is a fast and extremely user-friendly library that performs various language processing tasks. Once you load a spaCy model for a particular language, you can provide any text as input to the model, e.g. encoder(text) and access its linguistic features."

Each tokenized word in the reviews is added to the lexicon, and then each word is mapped to a numerical index that can be read by the model. Since large datasets may contain a huge number of unique words, it's common to filter all words occurring less than a certain number of times, and replace them with some generic &lt;UNK&gt; token. The min_freq parameter in the function below defines this threshold. When assigning the indices, the number 1 will represent unknown words. The number 0 will represent \"empty\" word slots, which is explained below. Therefore \"real\" words will have indices of 2 or higher."

    "The input representation for the RNN explicitly encodes the order of words in the review. We'll return to the lists of the word indices contained in train_reviews['Review_Idxs']. The input to the model will be these number sequences themselves. We need to put all the reviews in the training set into a single matrix, where each row is a review and each column is a word index in that sequence. This enables the model to process multiple sequences in parallel (batches) as opposed to one at a time. Using batches significantly speeds up training. However, each review has a different number of words, so we create a padded matrix equal to the length on the longest review in the training set. For all reviews with fewer words, we prepend the row with zeros representing an empty word position. This is why the number 0 was not assigned as a word index in the lexicon. We can tell Keras to ignore these zeros during training."

    "**2. Embedding**: A [layer](https://keras.io/layers/embeddings/) that converts integer word indices into distributed vector representations (embeddings), which were introduced above. The difference here is that rather than plugging in embeddings from a pretrained model as before, the word embeddings will be learned inside the model itself. Thus, the input to the model will be the word indices rather than their embeddings, and the embedding values will change as the model is trained. The mask_zero=True parameter in this layer indicates that values of 0 in the matrix (the padding) will be ignored by the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. GRU**: A [recurrent (GRU) hidden layer](https://keras.io/layers/recurrent/), the central component of the model. As it observes each word in the review, it integrates the word embedding representation with what it's observed so far to compute a representation (hidden state) of the review at that timepoint. There are a few architectures for this layer - we use the GRU variation, Keras also provides LSTM or just the simple vanilla recurrent layer (see the materials at the bottom for an explanation of the difference). This layer outputs the last hidden state of the sequence (i.e. the hidden representation of the review after its last word is observed).\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Dense**: An output [layer](https://keras.io/layers/core/#dense) that predicts the rating for the review based on its GRU representation given by the previous layer. It has one dimension that contains a continuous value (the rating). Add a proper activation function.\n",

Keras' Functional API lets you derive a new model with the layers from an existing model, so you can define the output to be a layer below the output layer in the original model. Calling predict() on this new model will produce the output of that layer for a given input. Of course, glancing at the numbers by themselves doesn't provide any interpretation of what the model has learned (although there are opportunities to [interpret these values](https://medium.com/civis-analytics/interpreting-and-visualizing-neural-networks-for-text-processing-e9dff0da9c22), but seeing them verifies the model is just a series of transformations from one matrix to another. The model stores its layers as the list model.layers, and you can retrieve specific layer by its position index in the model."
